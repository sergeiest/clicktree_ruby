== Web application for Clicktree
www.clicktreelabs.com

We deploy an API solution for content-rich and ecommerce websites instantly, 
empowering their partners and affiliates to design APIs from the content. 

Developers can choose what specific content they want to see in a customized 
API and Clicktree then deploys this API. Thus our APIs provide significantly 
more flexibility than traditional affiliate marketing programs. In addition, 
we track and block unauthorized web scraping and redirect these scrapers to 
use the deployed API. Our clients are in complete control of who can access 
their data. We are currently running a pilot with several companies.

Our API solution is built on top of a web application, so it does not require 
any modifications from the website, i.e. does not require additional application 
architecture or development and can be deployed instantly. We also use machine 
learning to analyze the customerâ€™s traffic logs and on-site user behavior to 
identify and block web scraping.
